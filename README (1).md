It even detects whether a person is wearing mask properly or not i.e. below the chin. The whole program (code) was written in python using its various packages. The model for Mask detection was trained using 3833 images taken from Kaggle. For recognizing person and sending e-mail to the particular person, Face recognition and smtplib packages were used. The accuracy and validation accuracy of the trained model was 99.24% and 99.61% respectively.
